## Question 3 = (0 point) Container, iterator, function. Look at the source in One.cpp and in Two.cpp. This is partially to see how some generic functionality fits together.

### **Part (a): How do the two files differ?**

1. **Input Order of Elements in the List:**

   - In **One.cpp**, the elements are inserted in the order: `3, 13, 23, 15, 9, 13, 12, 33`.
   - In **Two.cpp**, the elements are inserted in the order: `33, 12, 13, 9, 15, 23, 13, 3`.

2. **Effect of Sorting:**
   - The difference in input order will affect how the list elements are processed by the `sort` function. Both programs use the same comparison function `compint`, but the initial order of elements influences the intermediate steps during sorting.

### **Part (b): Compile and Run Each Program**

To compile and run the programs:

1. **Compile the programs** using a C++17-compliant compiler:

   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++17 One.cpp -o One
   g++ -std=c++17 Two.cpp -o Two
   ```

2. **Run the compiled programs:**
   ```bash
   ./One
   ./Two
   ```

---

### **Part (c): What Do the Programs Do?**

#### Common Functionality:

1. **Insert Elements into a List:**

   - Both programs insert integers into a `std::list` container, albeit in a different order.

2. **Sort the List Using a Custom Comparator:**

   - The `compint` function compares two integers, `a` and `b`, after adjusting their values:
     ```cpp
     return a - 3 > b + 3;
     ```
     This means:
     - For the purpose of sorting, `a` is decreased by 3, and `b` is increased by 3.
     - The sorting criterion prioritizes values of `a` shifted "downward" over values of `b` shifted "upward."

3. **Iterate Through the Sorted List:**
   - After sorting, the programs iterate through the list and print each element.

#### Differences in Output:

Since the input order of elements differs between **One.cpp** and **Two.cpp**, the sorted outputs will likely differ. However, the final order of elements in each case is determined solely by the custom comparator.

---

### **Summary of Output**

1. **Output from One.cpp:**

   - Elements are sorted using the custom comparator. Due to the initial order, the final sorted list could look like:
     ```
     33
     23
     15
     13
     13
     12
     9
     3
     ```

2. **Output from Two.cpp:**
   - Sorting the same elements (in a different input order) results in the same final sorted list because the custom comparator is deterministic:
     ```
     33
     23
     15
     13
     13
     12
     9
     3
     ```

---

### Conclusion

- **How do they differ?** The two programs only differ in the input order of the elements added to the list.
- **What do they do?** Both programs sort the list using the custom comparator `compint` and then output the sorted list. The sorted output is the same in both cases due to the deterministic nature of the comparator.
